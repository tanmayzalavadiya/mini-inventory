## What I Learned
- MERN Stack Development: I gained proficiency in developing full-stack web applications using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

- User Authentication: I learned how to implement user authentication, including login, sign-up, and password management, to secure the application.

- Email Notifications: I mastered the integration of email functionality, enabling users to receive password reset emails and notifications about out-of-stock products.
